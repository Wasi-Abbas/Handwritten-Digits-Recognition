# Project Title: Handwritten Digit Recognition using Keras Sequential Model

# Description:
Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning. This project aims to develop a deep learning model using the Keras library's sequential architecture to accurately classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains a large collection of grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

# Key Components:
Data Preparation: The project begins by loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset. The dataset is split into training and testing sets. Each image is converted into a matrix of pixel values and normalized to ensure consistent training.

Model Architecture: A Keras sequential model is designed to capture the spatial features of the handwritten digits. The model comprises multiple layers of artificial neurons, including convolutional layers for feature extraction and pooling layers for downsampling. These are followed by one or more fully connected layers to make predictions.

Training: The model is trained using the training dataset. During training, the model learns to adjust its internal parameters to minimize the difference between predicted digit labels and actual labels. This process involves optimizing a chosen loss function using an optimization algorithm like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.

Evaluation: The trained model's performance is evaluated using the testing dataset. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

Hyperparameter Tuning: To improve model performance, hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of layers or neurons are tuned through experimentation.

Deployment: Once a satisfactory model is achieved, it can be deployed for real-world digit recognition tasks. This could involve integrating the model into a user interface where users can input handwritten digits for recognition.

# Outcome:
The successful completion of this project will result in a trained deep learning model capable of accurately recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project showcases the application of the Keras sequential model for image classification tasks and demonstrates the potential of deep learning in solving real-world problems.
